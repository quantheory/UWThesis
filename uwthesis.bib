    abstract = { AbstractPrognostic precipitation is added to a cloud microphysical scheme for global climate models. Results indicate very similar performance to other commonly used mesoscale schemes in an offline driver for idealized warm rain cases, better than the previous version of the global model microphysics scheme with diagnostic precipitation. In the mixed phase regime, there is significantly more water and less ice, which may address a common bias seen with the scheme in climate simulations in the Arctic. For steady forcing cases, the scheme has limited sensitivity to time step out to the ~15-min time steps typical of global models. The scheme is similar to other schemes with moderate sensitivity to vertical resolution. The limited time step sensitivity bodes well for use of the scheme in multiscale models from the mesoscale to the large scale. The scheme is sensitive to idealized perturbations of cloud drop and crystal number. Precipitation decreases and condensate increases with increasing drop number, indicating substantial decreases in precipitation efficiency. The sensitivity is less than with the previous version of the scheme for low drop number concentrations (Nc < 100 cm−3). Ice condensate increases with ice number, with large decreases in liquid condensate as well for a mixed phase case. As expected with prognostic precipitation, accretion is stronger than with diagnostic precipitation and the accretion to autoconversion ratio increases faster with liquid water path (LWP), in better agreement with idealized models and earlier studies than the previous version.}

abstract = {A modified microphysics scheme is implemented in the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5). The new scheme features prognostic precipitation. The coupling between the microphysics and the rest of the model is modified to make it more flexible. Single-column tests show the new microphysics can simulate a constrained drizzling stratocumulus case. Substepping the cloud condensation (macrophysics) within a time step improves single-column results. Simulations of mixed-phase cases are strongly sensitive to ice nucleation. The new microphysics alters process rates in both single-column and global simulations, even at low (200 km) horizontal resolution. Thus, prognostic precipitation can be important, even in low-resolution simulations where advection of precipitation is not important. Accretion dominates as liquid water path increases in agreement with cloud-resolving model simulations and estimates from observations. The new microphysics with prognostic precipitation increases the ratio of accretion over autoconversion. The change in process rates appears to significantly reduce aerosol–cloud interactions and indirect radiative effects of anthropogenic aerosols by up to 33{\%} (depending on substepping) to below 1 W m 22 of cooling between simulations with preindustrial (1850) and present-day (2000) aerosol emissions.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper evaluates the numerical convergence of very short (1 h) simulations carried out with a spectral-element (SE) configuration of the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5). While the horizontal grid spacing is fixed at approximately 110 km, the process-coupling time step is varied between 1800 and 1 s to reveal the convergence rate with respect to the temporal resolution. Special attention is paid to the behavior of the parameterized subgrid-scale physics. First, a dynamical core test with reduced dynamics time steps is presented. The results demonstrate that the experimental setup is able to correctly assess the convergence rate of the discrete solutions to the adiabatic equations of atmospheric motion. Second, results from full-physics CAM5 simulations with reduced physics and dynamics time steps are discussed. It is shown that the convergence rate is 0.4—considerably slower than the expected rate of 1.0. Sensitivity experiments indicate that, among the various subgrid-scale physical parameterizations, the stratiform cloud schemes are associated with the largest time-stepping errors, and are the primary cause of slow time step convergence. While the details of our findings are model specific, the general test procedure is applicable to any atmospheric general circulation model. The need for more accurate numerical treatments of physical parameterizations, especially the representation of stratiform clouds, is likely common in many models. The suggested test technique can help quantify the time-stepping errors and identify the related model sensitivities.},

abstract = {Abstract This work documents the first version of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) new Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). We focus on the standard resolution of the fully coupled physical model designed to address DOE mission-relevant water cycle questions. Its components include atmosphere and land (110-km grid spacing), ocean and sea ice (60 km in the midlatitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles), and river transport (55 km) models. This base configuration will also serve as a foundation for additional configurations exploring higher horizontal resolution as well as augmented capabilities in the form of biogeochemistry and cryosphere configurations. The performance of E3SMv1 is evaluated by means of a standard set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations consisting of a long preindustrial control, historical simulations (ensembles of fully coupled and prescribed SSTs) as well as idealized CO2 forcing simulations. The model performs well overall with biases typical of other CMIP-class models, although the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is weaker than many CMIP-class models. While the E3SMv1 historical ensemble captures the bulk of the observed warming between preindustrial (1850) and present day, the trajectory of the warming diverges from observations in the second half of the twentieth century with a period of delayed warming followed by an excessive warming trend. Using a two-layer energy balance model, we attribute this divergence to the model's strong aerosol-related effective radiative forcing (ERFari+aci = −1.65 W/m2) and high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS = 5.3 K).},

abstract = {Abstract The Energy Exascale Earth System Model Atmosphere Model version 1, the atmospheric component of the Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model is described. The model began as a fork of the well-known Community Atmosphere Model, but it has evolved in new ways, and coding, performance, resolution, physical processes (primarily cloud and aerosols formulations), testing and development procedures now differ significantly. Vertical resolution was increased (from 30 to 72 layers), and the model top extended to 60 km (~0.1 hPa). A simple ozone photochemistry predicts stratospheric ozone, and the model now supports increased and more realistic variability in the upper troposphere and stratosphere. An optional improved treatment of light-absorbing particle deposition to snowpack and ice is available, and stronger connections with Earth system biogeochemistry can be used for some science problems. Satellite and ground-based cloud and aerosol simulators were implemented to facilitate evaluation of clouds, aerosols, and aerosol-cloud interactions. Higher horizontal and vertical resolution, increased complexity, and more predicted and transported variables have increased the model computational cost and changed the simulations considerably. These changes required development of alternate strategies for tuning and evaluation as it was not feasible to “brute force” tune the high-resolution configurations, so short-term hindcasts, perturbed parameter ensemble simulations, and regionally refined simulations provided guidance on tuning and parameterization sensitivity to higher resolution. A brief overview of the model and model climate is provided. Model fidelity has generally improved compared to its predecessors and the CMIP5 generation of climate models.},

abstract = {Abstract This study provides comprehensive insight into the notable differences in clouds and precipitation simulated by the Energy Exascale Earth System Model Atmosphere Model version 0 and version 1 (EAMv1). Several sensitivity experiments are conducted to isolate the impact of changes in model physics, resolution, and parameter choices on these differences. The overall improvement in EAMv1 clouds and precipitation is primarily attributed to the introduction of a simplified third-order turbulence parameterization Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals (along with the companion changes) for a unified treatment of boundary layer turbulence, shallow convection, and cloud macrophysics, though it also leads to a reduction in subtropical coastal stratocumulus clouds. This lack of stratocumulus clouds is considerably improved by increasing vertical resolution from 30 to 72 layers, but the gain is unfortunately subsequently offset by other retuning to reach the top-of-atmosphere energy balance. Increasing vertical resolution also results in a considerable underestimation of high clouds over the tropical warm pool, primarily due to the selection for numerical stability of a higher air parcel launch level in the deep convection scheme. Increasing horizontal resolution from 1° to 0.25° without retuning leads to considerable degradation in cloud and precipitation fields, with much weaker tropical and subtropical short- and longwave cloud radiative forcing and much stronger precipitation in the intertropical convergence zone, indicating poor scale awareness of the cloud parameterizations. To avoid this degradation, significantly different parameter settings for the low-resolution (1°) and high-resolution (0.25°) were required to achieve optimal performance in EAMv1.},

It is a continuous Galerkin spectral finite-element method designed for fully unstructured quadrilateral meshes. The current configurations in CAM are based on the cubed-sphere grid. The main motivation for including a spectral element dynamical core is to improve the scalability of CAM by allowing quasi-uniform grids for the sphere that do not require polar filters. In addition, the approach provides other state-of-the-art capabilities such as improved conservation properties. Spectral elements are used for the horizontal discretization, while most other aspects of the dynamical core are a hybrid of well-tested techniques from CAM’s finite volume and global spectral dynamical core options. Here we first give an overview of the spectral element dynamical core as used in CAM. We then give scalability and performance results from CAM running with three different dynamical core options within the Community Earth System Model, using a pre-industrial time-slice configuration. We focus on high-resolution simulations, using 1/4 degree, 1/8 degree, and T341 spectral truncation horizontal grids. }

    abstract = { Abstract A new two-moment stratiform cloud microphysics scheme in a general circulation model is described. Prognostic variables include cloud droplet and cloud ice mass mixing ratios and number concentrations. The scheme treats several microphysical processes, including hydrometeor collection, condensation/evaporation, freezing, melting, and sedimentation. The activation of droplets on aerosol is physically based and coupled to a subgrid vertical velocity. Unique aspects of the scheme, relative to existing two-moment schemes developed for general circulation models, are the diagnostic treatment of rain and snow number concentration and mixing ratio and the explicit treatment of subgrid cloud water variability for calculation of the microphysical process rates. Numerical aspects of the scheme are described in detail using idealized one-dimensional offline tests of the microphysics. Sensitivity of the scheme to time step, vertical resolution, and numerical method for diagnostic precipitation is investigated over a range of conditions. It is found that, in general, two substeps are required for numerical stability and reasonably small time truncation errors using a time step of 20 min; however, substepping is only required for the precipitation microphysical processes rather than the entire scheme. A new numerical approach for the diagnostic rain and snow produces reasonable results compared to a benchmark simulation, especially at low vertical resolution. Part II of this study details results of the scheme in single-column and global simulations, including comparison with observations. }

abstract = {Abstract Aqua-planet simulations with Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian dynamical cores coupled to the NCAR CCM3 parametrization suite produce very different zonal average precipitation patterns. The model with the Eulerian core forms a narrow single precipitation peak centred on the sea surface temperature (SST) maximum. The one with the semi-Lagrangian core forms a broad structure often with a double peak straddling the SST maximum with a precipitation minimum centred on the SST maximum. The different structure is shown to be caused primarily by the different time step adopted by each core and its effect on the parametrizations rather than by different truncation errors introduced by the dynamical cores themselves. With a longer discrete time step, the surface exchange parametrization deposits more moisture in the atmosphere in a single time step, resulting in convection being initiated farther from the equator, closer to the maximum source. Different diffusive smoothing associated with different spectral resolutions is a secondary effect influencing the strength of the double structure. When the semi-Lagrangian core is configured to match the Eulerian with the same time step, a three-time-level formulation and same spectral truncation it produces precipitation fields similar to those from the Eulerian. It is argued that the broad and double structure forms in this model with the longer time step because more water is put into the atmosphere over a longer discrete time step, the evaporation rate being the same. The additional water vapour in the region of equatorial moisture convergence results in more convective available potential energy farther from the equator which allows convection to initiate farther from the equator. The resulting heating drives upward vertical motion and low-level convergence away from the equator, resulting in much weaker upward motion at the equator. The feedback between the convective heating and dynamics reduces the instability at the equator and decreases the convection there. The behaviour of the parametrizations depends on the amount of water inserted into the troposphere during a discrete time step. This is as important as the rate of insertion. Experiments are described that support this explanation. Copyright © 2003 Royal Meteorological Society},

    abstract = { Abstract Several numerical experiments have been conducted using the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model, version 3 (CAM3) to examine the impact of the time step on rainfall in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in an aquaplanet. When the model time step was increased from 5 to 60 min the rainfall in the ITCZ decreased substantially. The impact of the time step on the ITCZ rainfall was assessed for a fixed spatial resolution (T63 with L26) for the semi-Lagrangian dynamical core (SLD). The increase in ITCZ rainfall at higher temporal resolution was primarily a result of the increase in large-scale precipitation. This increase in rainfall was caused by the positive feedback between surface evaporation, latent heating, and surface wind speed. Similar results were obtained when the semi-Lagrangian dynamical core was replaced by the Eulerian dynamical core. When the surface evaporation was specified, changes in rainfall were largely insensitive to temporal resolution. The impact of temporal resolution on rainfall was more sensitive to the latitudinal gradient of SST than to the magnitude of SST. }

A set of multi-year integrations are carried out in a real-planet framework using actual land–ocean distribution and observed sea surface temperature. Over the tropics there is an increase in total rainfall with a decrease in time step size. Using a lower time step, there is a decrease in the convective component of rainfall, however, the stratiform component increases, and more than compensates the decrease in the former, thus leading to a higher total rainfall. A decrease in time step leads to an increase in the frequencies of moderate, and heavy rainfall categories, which is responsible for the increase in time mean total rainfall over the tropics. Also, the spatial distribution of rainfall becomes more realistic during both summer and winter seasons. In regard to the simulation of equatorial waves, it is found that a lower time step leads to a reduction in the speed of Kelvin waves. The latent heating profile becomes more bottom-heavy with a reduction in time step size, which potentially leads to slower Kelvin waves. Finally, additional experiments conducted in an aqua-planet framework show a consistent and systematic change in the analyzed variables with change in time step, and hence confirm the robustness of the results across modeling frameworks.}

abstract = {Abstract The problem of intense, truncation-scale storms that form in high-resolution versions of the Community Atmosphere Model Version 4 (CAM4) is studied. These storms are characterized by extreme vertical motion and heavy precipitation. This problem arises when some individual parametrizations do not produce an atmospheric-like state because they are restrained by the time-scales assumed in their formulation; other unconstrained parametrizations that follow then work in unintended ways. The behaviour of the moist parametrization components is examined in CAM4 for one typical, strong cell. At T340 spectral truncation with a 5 min time step, the deep and shallow convection parametrizations do not remove instabilities and supersaturation because they have time-scales of 1 h and 30 min, respectively. Then the prognostic cloud-water scheme, which is not constrained by a time-scale, does remove supersaturation. That local release of latent heat drives very strong vertical motion and horizontal convergence, which transports even more water vapour into the column, exacerbating the problem. Two simple model problems are introduced that illustrate the ramifications of the time-scale and time-step mismatch. When either the time-scales are shortened or the time step is lengthened, the convection parametrizations are more active and strong storms do not form.

This coupling strategy is noncommutative in the sense that the order in which processes are called impacts the solution. By examining a suite of 24 simulations with deep convection, shallow convection, macrophysics/microphysics, and radiation parameterizations reordered, process order is shown to have a big impact on predicted climate. In particular, reordering of processes induces differences in net climate feedback that are as big as the intermodel spread in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. One reason why process ordering has such a large impact is that the effect of each process is influenced by the processes preceding it. Where output is written is therefore an important control on apparent model behavior. Application of k-means clustering demonstrates that the positioning of macro/microphysics and shallow convection plays a critical role on the model solution.},

    abstract = { Abstract The global performance of a new two-moment cloud microphysics scheme for a general circulation model (GCM) is presented and evaluated relative to observations. The scheme produces reasonable representations of cloud particle size and number concentration when compared to observations, and it represents expected and observed spatial variations in cloud microphysical quantities. The scheme has smaller particles and higher number concentrations over land than the standard bulk microphysics in the GCM and is able to balance the top-of-atmosphere radiation budget with 60\% the liquid water of the standard scheme, in better agreement with retrieved values. The new scheme diagnostically treats both the mixing ratio and number concentration of rain and snow, and it is therefore able to differentiate the two key regimes, consisting of drizzle in shallow, warm clouds and larger rain drops in deeper cloud systems. The modeled rain and snow size distributions are consistent with observations. }

	abstract = {A new parameterization with three prognostic liquid water classes was implemented into the general circulation model (GCM) ECHAM5 with the aerosol module HAM in order to improve the global representation of rain formation in marine stratiform clouds. The additionally introduced drizzle class improves the physical representation of the droplet spectrum and, more importantly, improves the microphysical processes relevant for precipitation formation compared to the standard parameterization. In order to avoid a mismatch of the liquid and ice phase, a prognostic treatment of snow has been introduced too. This has a significant effect on the amount and altitude of ice clouds, which in turn affects not only the in- and outgoing radiation but also the parameterized collection rates. With the introduction of a prognostic precipitation scheme, a more realistic representation of both liquid and ice phase large-scale precipitation is achieved compared to a diagnostic treatment. An encouraging finding is that with the prognostic treatment the increase of the liquid water path in response to anthropogenic aerosols is reduced by about 25 \%. Although the total net radiative forcing is decreased from −1.3±0.3 to −1.6±0.3 W m−2 from the control to the prognostic model version, the difference is within the interannual variability. Altogether the results suggest that the treatment of precipitation in global circulation models has not only a significant influence on the phase of clouds and their conversion rates, but also hints towards uncertainties related to a prognostic precipitation scheme.},

  abstract = {{A comprehensive two‐moment microphysics scheme is incorporated into the MIROC6‐SPRINTARS general circulation model (GCM). The new scheme includes prognostic precipitation for both rain and snow and considers their radiative effects. To evaluate the impacts of applying different treatments of precipitation and the associated radiative effect, we perform climate simulations employing both the traditional diagnostic and new prognostic precipitation schemes, the latter also being tested with and without incorporating the radiative effect of snow. The prognostic precipitation, which maintains precipitation in the atmosphere across multiple time steps, models the ratio of accretion to autoconversion as being approximately an order of magnitude higher than that for the diagnostic scheme. Such changes in microphysical process rates tend to reduce the cloud water susceptibility as the autoconversion process is the only pathway through which aerosols can influence rain formation. The resultant anthropogenic aerosol effect is reduced by approximately 21\% in the prognostic precipitation scheme. Modifications to the microphysical process rates also change the vertical distribution of hydrometeors in the manner that increases the fractional occurrence of single‐layered warm clouds by 38\%. The new scheme mitigates the excess of supercooled liquid water produced by the previous scheme and increases the total mass of ice hydrometeors. Both characteristics are consistent with CloudSat/CALIPSO retrievals. The radiative effect of snow is significant at both longwave and shortwave (6.4 and 5.1 W/m2 in absolute values, respectively) and can alter the precipitation fields via energetic controls on precipitation. These results suggest that the prognostic precipitation scheme, with its radiative effects incorporated, makes an indispensable contribution to improving the reliability of climate modeling. Prognostic precipitation (both rain and snow) and its radiative effects are introduced into the MIROC6‐SPRINTARS aerosol‐climate model Aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation‐climate interactions are evaluated using multisensor satellite data sets for different treatments of rain The radiative effect of snow is significant for both longwave and shortwave radiation and must be included for more reliable climate modeling}},

  abstract = {{A large-scale condensation scheme, able to treat separately both atmospheric cloud condensate and precipitation content in a prognostic way, has been implemented and validated in Météo-France's operational global model, ARPEGE. The proposed scheme can be used for climate simulations and short-range numerical weather prediction, although it was originally designed for the future variational assimilation of cloud and precipitation observations. The main originalities of the scheme, compared with other existing schemes having a similar moderate level of complexity, lie in the inclusion of a prognostic variable for rain and snow content, and in the use of a simple semi-Lagrangian treatment of the fall of precipitation. The calculations of large-scale condensation/evapora tion and cloud fraction are based on probability-density functions, and the parametrized microphysical processes that involve precipitation are autoconversion, collection, and evaporation/sublimation. Various observations, which include satellite data from METEOSAT and from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Special Sensor Microwave Imager, have been used for validating the cloud scheme within three-dimensional ARPEGE simulations at operational resolution for cases from the Fronts and Atlantic Storm-Track Experiment. These ARPEGE simulations have also been compared with 10 km runs obtained with the Met Office's Unified Model and with the French Méso-NH research model. In addition, cloud radar, ceilometer, and lidar observations from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement project have been utilized for validating the simulation of a synoptic winter cloud system over the southern Great Plains in the USA. The behaviour of the scheme was then assessed at a coarser resolution, with a particular focus on the zonal-mean radiative budget of the earth and the zonal-mean cloud cover. Finally, the question of the sensitivity of the results from the new scheme to various parameters has been addressed, including the time step and the specification of the fall velocities for rain and snow.

    abstract = { Abstract Microphysical processes responsible for the formation and dissipation of water and ice clouds have been incorporated into the Colorado State University General Circulation Model in order to 1) yield a more physically based representation of the components of the atmospheric moisture budget, 2) link the distribution and optical properties of the model-generated clouds to the predicted cloud water and ice amounts, and 3) produce more realistic simulations of cloudiness and the earth's radiation budget. The bulk cloud microphysics scheme encompasses five prognostic variables for the mass of water vapor, cloud water, cloud ice, rain, and snow. Graupel and hail are neglected. Cloud water and cloud ice are predicted to form through large-scale condensation and deposition processes and also through detrainment at the tops of cumulus towers. The production of rain and snow occur through autoconversion of cloud water and cloud ice. Rain drops falling through clouds can grow by collecting cloud water, and falling snow can collect both cloud water and cloud ice. These collection processes are formulated using the continuous collection equation. Evaporation of cloud water, cloud ice, rain, and snow are allowed in subsaturated layers. Melting and freezing are included. We also provide a coupling between convective clouds and stratiform anvils through the detrainment of cloud water and cloud ice at the tops of cumulus towers. Interactive cloud optical properties provide the link between the cloud n-microphysics and radiation parameterizations; the optical depths and infrared emissivities of large-scale stratiform clouds are parameterized in terms of the cloud water and cloud ice paths. Two annual-cycle numerical simulations are performed to assess the impact of cloud microphysics on the hydrological cycle. In the “EAULIQ” run, large-scale moist processes and cloud optical properties are driven by the bulk cloud microphysics parameterization. In the “CONTROL” run, condensed water is immediately removed from the atmosphere in the form of rain, which may evaporate as it falls through subsaturated layers. Stratiform ice clouds are not considered in CONTROL. When clouds are present, cloud optical depths and cloud infrared emissivities are dependent on the mean cloud temperatures. Results are presented in terms of January and July monthly averages. Emphasis is placed on the spatial distributions of cloud water, cloud ice, rain, and snow produced by the cloud microphysics scheme. In EAULIQ, cloud water and cloud ice are more abundant in the middle latitudes than in the Tropics, suggesting that large-scale condensation contributes a major part to the production of condensed water. Comparisons between the simulated vertically integrated cloud water and die columnar cloud water retrievals from satellite microwave measurements over the global oceans indicate a reasonable agreement. Interactions between the cloud micro- physics and cumulus convection parameterizations lead to smaller, more realistic precipitation rates. In particular, the cumulus precipitation rate is strongly reduced when compared to CONTROL. }

    abstract = { AbstractTwo-moment multiclass microphysics schemes are very promising tools to be used in high-resolution NWP models. However, they must be adapted for coarser resolutions. Here, a twofold solution is proposed—namely, a simple representation of subgrid cloud and precipitation fraction—as well as a microphysical sub-time-stepping method. The scheme is easy to implement, allows supersaturation in ice cloud, and exhibits flexibility for adoption across model grid spacing. It is implemented in the Milbrandt and Yau two-moment microphysics scheme with prognostic precipitation in the context of a simple 1D kinematic model as well as a mesoscale NWP model [the Canadian regional Global Environmental Multiscale model (GEM)]. Sensitivity tests were performed and the results highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the two-moment multiclass cloud scheme relative to the classical Sundqvist scheme. The respective roles of subgrid cloud fraction, precipitation fraction, and time splitting were also studied. When compared to the Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO)/CloudSat-retrieved cloud mask, cloud fraction, and ice water content, it is found that the proposed solutions significantly improve the behavior of the Milbrandt and Yau microphysics scheme at the regional NWP scale, suggesting that the subgrid cloud and precipitation fraction technique can be used across model resolutions. }

    abstract = { AbstractThe influence of six CAM5.1 cloud microphysical parameters on the variance of phase partitioning in mixed-phase clouds is determined by application of a variance-based sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis is based on a generalized linear model that assumes a polynomial relationship between the six parameters and the two-way interactions between them. The parameters, bounded such that they yield realistic cloud phase values, were selected by adopting a quasi–Monte Carlo sampling approach. The sensitivity analysis is applied globally, and to 20°-latitude-wide bands, and over the Southern Ocean at various mixed-phase cloud isotherms and reveals that the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) time scale for the growth of ice crystals single-handedly accounts for the vast majority of the variance in cloud phase partitioning in mixed-phase clouds, while its interaction with the WBF time scale for the growth of snowflakes plays a secondary role. The fraction of dust aerosols active as ice nuclei in latitude bands, and the parameter related to the ice crystal fall speed and their interactions with the WBF time scale for ice are also significant. All other investigated parameters and their interactions with each other are negligible (<3\%). Further analysis comparing three of the quasi–Monte Carlo–sampled simulations with spaceborne lidar observations by CALIOP suggests that the WBF process in CAM5.1 is currently parameterized such that it occurs too rapidly due to failure to account for subgrid-scale variability of liquid and ice partitioning in mixed-phase clouds. }

abstract = {Abstract This study systematically evaluates clouds simulated by the Energy Exascale Earth System Model Atmosphere Model version 1 (EAMv1) against satellite cloud observations. Both low- (1°) and high- (0.25°) resolution EAMv1 configurations generally underestimate clouds in low latitudes and midlatitudes and overestimate clouds in the Arctic, although the error is smaller in the high-resolution model. The underestimate of clouds is due to the underestimate of optically thin to intermediate clouds, as EAMv1 generally overestimates optically intermediate to thick clouds. Other model errors include the largely underpredicted marine stratocumulus along the coasts and high clouds over the tropical deep convection regions. The underestimate of thin clouds results in too much longwave radiation being emitted to space and too little shortwave radiation being reflected back to space, while the overestimate of optically intermediate and thick clouds leads to too little longwave radiation being emitted to space and too much shortwave radiation being reflected back to space. EAMv1 shows better skill in reproducing the observed distribution of clouds and their properties and has smaller radiatively relevant errors in the distribution of clouds than most of the CFMIP1 and CFMIP2 models. It produces more supercooled liquid cloud fraction than CAM5 and most CMIP5 models primarily due to a new ice nucleation scheme and secondarily due to a reduction of the ice deposition growth rate.},

abstract = {Abstract At the present time there exist a number of different approaches to the problem of coupling parametrized physical processes to the dynamical core in operational numerical weather-prediction (NWP) and climate models. Motivated by the various strategies in use, some idealized representative coupling schemes are constructed and subsequently analysed using a methodology in which the physics and dynamics terms are represented in a simplified way. Particular numerical properties of the idealized schemes which are of interest are the ability to capture correct steady-state solutions and to be second-order accurate in time. In general, the schemes require specific choices for the time-differencing of certain coupled processes if correct steady-state solutions are to be obtained. This has implications for the overall numerical stability of a coupling strategy. An alternative physics–dynamics coupling approach is then described and analysed. A multiple-sweep predictor–corrector coupling scheme is shown to capture the correct steady-state solution and to allow for second-order accuracy, provided that the convective process is coupled explicitly. This approach has a number of advantages over those currently used in operational NWP models. Copyright © 2006 Crown copyright},

    abstract = { Abstract Split schemes for time-stepping physical parameterizations in numerical weather prediction and climate models are investigated within the context of simplified model equations. A symmetrized-splitting technique is applied to various parameterized systems containing fast and slow physics processes. The physics processes are represented by time-dependent forcing terms and linear damping/oscillatory terms. Finite-difference schemes, obtained from the splitting procedures, are examined to determine their stability properties, degree of splitting error, and truncation error. This analysis provides insight into the advantages and disadvantages of different splitting procedures across a range of possible parameterization scenarios. Many schemes obtained via splitting have time-step-dependent splitting errors, which can lead to inaccurate solutions when fast processes are present and the time step is large. Some splitting combinations, however, are more useful than others. The symmetrized-splitting procedure considered in this paper can produce stable first- and second-order accurate schemes, which have either no significant splitting errors or acceptably small errors relative to a steady-state solution. The consequences of this analysis for physics coupling strategies in realistic numerical weather prediction and climate models are noted. }

This problem models the dynamics by a representation of the terms responsible for gravitational oscillations and models the physics by both a constant forcing term and a linear damping term, representative of horizontal or vertical diffusion. The schemes have been analyzed in terms of their numerical stability and accuracy. Two of the schemes (the explicit and split-implicit) have been studied previously in the context of a three-time-level discretization. Those results are confirmed here for a two-time-level discretization. The two other schemes (the implicit and the novel symmetrized split-implicit) are both found to be second-order accurate and unconditionally stable, and both represent improvements over the explicit and split-implicit schemes. The symmetrized split-implicit has the additional advantage over the implicit scheme, for simplicity and computational efficiency, of separating the physics and dynamics steps from each other. The canonical problem considered here is a considerable simplification of any real physics–dynamics coupling, which limits the generality of the conclusions drawn. However, such simplification allows detailed analysis of some important aspects and motivates further work on both broadening and deepening understanding of physics–dynamics coupling issues. }

For large time steps, a useful scheme should produce an accurate discrete representation of the reduced system, which has fast modes removed. Parallel splitting may be of limited use because only explicit versions model reduced systems without splitting errors, but such versions cannot stably integrate fast modes with acceptably large time steps. In a numerical context, sequential-splitting schemes are more flexible. Second-order schemes can be more accurate than first-order ones if the time step is very large, provided careful data initialization is performed to prevent noisy solutions for stiff problems. }

abstract = {Abstract Simultaneous calculation of atmospheric processes is faster than calculating processes one at a time. This type of parallelism is beneficial or perhaps even necessary to provide good performance on modern supercomputers, which achieve faster performance through increased processor count rather than improved clock speed. The scalability of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Atmosphere Model (EAM) is limited by the fluid dynamics which scales up to the number of mesh cells in the global mesh. In contrast, the suite of physics parameterizations in EAM is scalable up to the total number of physics columns, which is an order of magnitude greater than the number of mesh cells. A proposed solution to unlocking the greater potential performance from the physics suite is to solve the physics and dynamics in parallel. This work represents a first attempt at parallel splitting of the grid-scale fluid dynamics model and the subgrid-scale physics parameterizations in a global atmosphere model. We will demonstrate that switching to parallel physics-dynamics coupling extends the scalability of the EAM to up to 3 times the previous peak scalability limit and is up to 20\% faster than the sequentially split coupling at the highest core counts and the same time step. Decadal simulations of both coupling approaches show very little impact to the model climate. This improved performance does not come without drawbacks, however. Parallel splitting requires a shorter time step and other modifications which largely offset performance gains. A mass fixer is required for conservation. Techniques for mitigating these issues are also discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract The effect of global climate model (GCM) time step—which also controls how frequently global and embedded cloud resolving scales are coupled—is examined in the Superparameterized Community Atmosphere Model ver 3.0. Systematic bias reductions of time-mean shortwave cloud forcing (∼10 W/m2) and longwave cloud forcing (∼5 W/m2) occur as scale coupling frequency increases, but with systematically increasing rainfall variance and extremes throughout the tropics. An overarching change in the vertical structure of deep tropical convection, favoring more bottom-heavy deep convection as a global model time step is reduced may help orchestrate these responses. The weak temperature gradient approximation is more faithfully satisfied when a high scale coupling frequency (a short global model time step) is used. These findings are distinct from the global model time step sensitivities of conventionally parameterized GCMs and have implications for understanding emergent behaviors of multiscale deep convective organization in superparameterized GCMs. The results may also be useful for helping to tune them.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The convergence of simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model with increasing resolution is determined in an aqua-planet context. Convergence as a function of scale is considered. Horizontal resolution (T42–T340) and time step (40–5 min) are varied separately. The simulations are sensitive to both. Global averages do not necessarily converge with increasing resolution. The zonal average equatorial precipitation shows a strong sensitivity to time step. Parametrizations should be applied in a range of time steps where such sensitivity is not seen. The larger scales of the zonal average equatorial precipitation converge with increasing resolution. There is a mass shift from polar to equatorial regions with increasing resolution with no indication of convergence. The zonal average cloud fraction decreases with increasing resolution with no indication of convergence. Equatorial wave propagation characteristics converge with increasing resolution, however a relatively high truncation of T170 is required to capture wavenumbers less than 16. Extremes are studied in the form of the probability density functions of precipitation. The largest half of the scales of the model converge for resolutions above T85.},

abstract = {Abstract Climate models rely on parameterizations of a variety of processes in the atmospheric physics, but a common concern is that the temporal resolution is too coarse to consistently resolve the behavior that individual parameterizations are designed to capture. This study examines timescales numerically derived from the Morrison-Gettelman (MG2) microphysics as implemented within the Energy Exascale Earth System Model, version 1 (E3SMv1). Numerically relevant timescales in MG2 are derived by computing the eigenspectrum of its Jacobian. These timescales are found to often be smaller than the default 5 min time step used for MG2. The fast timescales are then heuristically connected to individual microphysics processes. By substepping a few particular rain processes within MG2, the time discretization error for those processes was considerably reduced with minimal additional expense to the overall microphysics. While this improvement has a substantial effect on the target processes and on the vertical distribution of stratiform-derived rain within E3SMv1, the overall model climate is found to not be sensitive to MG2 time step. We hypothesize that this is because the surface climate does not depend strongly on certain process rates, especially MG2's rain evaporation rate.},

abstract = {In this study, we find significant sensitivity to the choice of time step for the Energy Exascale Earth System Model’s atmospheric component, leading to large decreases in the magnitude of cloud forcing when the time step is reduced to 10 seconds. Reducing the time step size for the microphysics increases precipitation, leading to a drying of the atmosphere and an increase in surface evaporation. This effect is amplified when the microphysics is substepped together with other cloud physics processes. Coupling the model’s dynamics and physics more frequently reduces cloud fraction at lower altitudes, while producing more cloud liquid at higher altitudes. Reducing the deep convection time step also reduces low cloud mass and cloud fraction. Together, these results suggest that cloud physics in a global circulation model can depend strongly on time step, and in particular on the frequency with which cloud-related processes are coupled with each other and with the model dynamics.}

This is the first application of the linear forcing-feedback regression analysis of Gregory et al. (2004) to an ensemble of AOGCMs. The range of equilibrium climate sensitivity is 2.1–4.7 K. Differences in cloud feedbacks continue to be important contributors to this range. Some models show small deviations from a linear dependence of top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes on global surface temperature change. We show that this phenomenon largely arises from shortwave cloud radiative effects over the ocean and is consistent with independent estimates of forcing using fixed sea-surface temperature methods. We suggest that future research should focus more on understanding transient climate change, including any time-scale dependence of the forcing and/or feedback, rather than on the equilibrium response to large instantaneous forcing.},

abstract = {Abstract Equilibrium climate sensitivity, the global surface temperature response to CO doubling, has been persistently uncertain. Recent consensus places it likely within 1.5–4.5 K. Global climate models (GCMs), which attempt to represent all relevant physical processes, provide the most direct means of estimating climate sensitivity via CO quadrupling experiments. Here we show that the closely related effective climate sensitivity has increased substantially in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), with values spanning 1.8–5.6 K across 27 GCMs and exceeding 4.5 K in 10 of them. This (statistically insignificant) increase is primarily due to stronger positive cloud feedbacks from decreasing extratropical low cloud coverage and albedo. Both of these are tied to the physical representation of clouds which in CMIP6 models lead to weaker responses of extratropical low cloud cover and water content to unforced variations in surface temperature. Establishing the plausibility of these higher sensitivity models is imperative given their implied societal ramifications.},

To better interpret the origin of that uncertainty, we analyze the sensitivity of the tropical cloud radiative forcing to a change in sea surface temperature that is simulated by 15 coupled models simulating climate change and current interannual variability. We show that it is in regimes of large-scale subsidence that the model results (1) differ the most in climate change and (2) disagree the most with observations in the current climate (most models underestimate the interannual sensitivity of clouds albedo to a change in temperature). This suggests that the simulation of the sensitivity of marine boundary layer clouds to changing environmental conditions constitutes, currently, the main source of uncertainty in tropical cloud feedbacks simulated by general circulation models.},
